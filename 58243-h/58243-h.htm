<h1>THE<br />
KOREA REVIEW.<br />
<span class="smaller">MAY, 1905.</span></h1>

<h2 id="Korea_and_Japan">Korea and Japan.</h2>

<p>The attitude of the Korean people toward Japan has
undergone many changes during that past quarter of a
century. The thing that we must always reckon with is
the ancient feeling of enmity aroused, in the first place,
by the devastating raids of Japanese freebooters during
the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries. At that time
the Koreans suffered so severely that the very name of
Japanese became the synonym of all that was dreadful
and to be hated. This was further intensified by the
great invasion of 1592 when the Koreans suffered untold
things at the hands of the temporary conquerors. The
result of these things are clearly seen in Korean character
today. It would be very hard to find a Korean child
who does not drink in, almost with his mother’s milk, a
feeling of dislike against the Japanese. On the other
hand the Japanese seem to have imbibed as strong a feeling
toward the Korean. This feeling is one of contempt,
born of the less warlike character of the Korean and his
strong conservatism.</p>

<p>These sentiments we firmly believe to be the real underlying
ones and if so the only genuine <i>rapprochement</i>
between the two people must be along the line of mutual
self-interest. If it <i>pays</i> sufficiently to forget the old feud
then forgotten it will be, but it is plain that the interest
must be a mutual one.</p>

<p>From the days of the Great Invasion up to the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
1868 the difficulties between Korea and Japan were
quiescent, though by no means dead. After the Manchu
invasion of Korea the Japanese even offered Korea help
in throwing off the Manchu yoke. As we look at conditions
today we can almost say that it was a pity Korea
did not accept the offer.</p>

<p>The late Regent, during the first decade of the present
reign, conceived a fanatical hatred against all outsiders
and, through a few unfortunate victories over them,
conceived the idea of hermetically sealing the country
against foreign intercourse. He adopted the one course
which was sure to effect the opening of the country,
namely by banning the Japanese commercial settlement
at Fusan. This was just at the time of Japan’s great
awakening and it is probable that she sincerely hoped
and believed that Korea was capable of taking the same
forward step which she herself was taking. When, therefore,
Korea not only took no forward step even but attempted
to retire more deeply into her political solitude
she aroused a good deal of feeling in Japan, a feeling that
was so intense that it resulted in a sanguinary civil war
called the Satsuma Rebellion. The leaders of the people
in the Southern island of Kiusiu, which lies nearest to
Korea, earnestly desired that Japan should force upon
Korea at the point of the sword what time has at last
effected. If the leaders of that rebellion could have looked
forward to the year 1905 they would have left their
swords in their scabbards.</p>

<p>In opposition to these advocates of force the new
government in Tokyo took the wholly reasonable and
laudable ground that Korea should be treated as a
coördinate and independent power and that she should
be approached from the diplomatic rather than the
military side. The rebellion which resulted caused a long
delay in the carrying out of any plans that Japan may
have formed relative to the opening up of Korea. At
the same time the approaching majority of the King of
Korea, and the consequent retirement of the Regent,
was sure to cause important changes in the attitude of
the peninsular government. This became all the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
evident as the queen and her powerful faction developed
a feeling of strong hostility to the person and the policy
of the Regent.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of this rift in the Korean lute the
Japanese sent a semi-official agent in the person of Hanabusa
who found means to secure frequent access to the
Queen and her party and who doubtless used every argument
to widen the breach between the Queen and the Regent.
When everything was ready the Japanese warship
<i>Unyo Kan</i> appeared off the Korean coast near Chemulpo
and got herself fired upon by a Korean fort. This was
the last, the dying act of the Regent, but it formed an
opening wedge for the negotiations which were immediately
instituted and which resulted in the signing of the
treaty between Korea and Japan at Kangwha in 1876.
The Regent had already retired from public life in disgust,
although his friends were constantly plotting to bring
him back to Seoul and reinstate him in power.</p>

<p>The years 1876-1880 form one of the most important
periods in the modern history of Korea, even though
they were very quiet years. The king had entered upon
his career and his course was to be determined upon.
The court was in a plastic state ready to be moulded
into any form which a strong mind might suggest.
Chinese suzerainty had slept so long and was so nominal
in character that no protest was forthcoming even when
Korea and Japan signed a treaty as between wholly independent
powers. The ruling faction had come into
power through the help of the Japanese. The latter recognized
to the fullest extent the independence of Korea.
There was every reason in the world why Japan should
use her powerful influence to direct the stream of Korean
politics into safe and progressive channels. She had
an unparalleled opportunity. Everything was in her
favor. England never began to have such a favorable
outlook in India as Japan had in Korea beginning with
the year 1876.</p>

<p>What then, was the reason for the comparative failure
that resulted? There can be but one answer. The Japanese
failed to study the situation closely enough and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
gauge the quality of the instrument by means of which
Korea must be led. The king was young and physically
strong and a long reign was to be expected. His will
was led by the powerful Min faction. It was the province
of statesmanship to study these factors and so
gauge their qualities as to be able to mould them in the
forms desired. The central figure was the Queen. The
country and the court went with her. She was young
and impressionable and favorably impressed by the Japanese.
Behind her was the Min faction, strong, ambitious,
selfish, tenacious of its prerogatives. That faction
was itself impressionable. It recognized that a new era
was opening, that the policy of the Regent had been cast
aside. It felt the incentive of national independence and
was ready and willing to undertake the responsible work
of leading the nation into these new and untrodden
paths; but first and most of all it held to its own prestige.
The selfish element was preeminent. There was no
love of country, detached and altruistic. It was their
conviction that the progress of the country would enhance
their own prestige. The motive was not a very
high one but such as it was it should have received careful
study from the Japanese before it was rejected. The latter
strongly favored a radical change in Korean conditions,
a change for which Korea had received no such preparation
as Japan had received and for which it was not
ready. There were two things which might cause such
a radical change as that of the Japanese—education or
the rise of an intense nationalistic spirit. It was the
latter which worked in Japan, but in Korea there was
neither education nor a national spirit to work upon.
These things had yet to be evolved.</p>

<p>The Japanese saw with impatience the slowness of
the Koreans to take advantage of their opportunity and
it was this impatience which spoiled the whole thing.
If the Japanese could have realized the mental and traditional
standpoint of the Koreans at that time and could
have exercised tact and large patience the outcome might
have been very different, but the truth is that the Japanese
were as unable to understand the Koreans as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Koreans were to understand them. There were a few
Koreans who seem to have taken hold of the problem in
the same spirit as the Japanese but they were in such a
hopeless minority and they were so far ahead of their
time that the Japanese made a damaging mistake in
forsaking the ruling faction and pinning their faith to
these few progressives. Of course the ideas of these progressives
were excellent. What they proposed would have
been for the good of the country, but they had no public
sentiment behind them and their views were so radical
as to bar them from the field of practical politics. It is
not good statesmanship to attempt what is better than
the best thing possible, and the mistake the Japanese
made at that critical point was in supposing that the
Korean people would fall in with a radical progressive
policy.</p>

<p>The result was seen in 1884 when, throwing over
diplomacy, they assisted the Korean radicals in a sanguinary
<i>emeute</i> in which seven cold-blooded murders
proved the quality of the would-be reformers. Here we
see a second case in which a diplomatic failure was tided
over by military force. But even so they did not succeed,
for the Chinese, who were on the scene and who had
been making high bids for the Queen’s favor by kidnapping
the Regent and carrying him away to China, were in
greater force than the Japanese and virtually forced
their retirement.</p>

<p>Up to this time people had not greatly favored either
the Chinese or Japanese influence but if anything were
inclined toward the latter. But now the ruling faction
turned wholly toward China and with it went the mass
of the people. The common people did not understand
nor appreciate the ideals of the progressives, and the
death of seven government ministers effectually weaned
away what little fealty they had given to the progressive
cause.</p>

<p>A new phase of the situation now opened during
which the high-handed acts of the Chinese Minister
alarmed the better class of Koreans and made them think
more kindly of the Japanese who had at least not tampered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
with the independence of the country. Japanese
diplomacy did all it could during this period to stem the
rising tide of Chinese influence, but the Queen was so
constituted mentally that having once conceived a
thorough dislike for any person or policy it was well-nigh
impossible to change. From the time when the
Japanese, in 1884, helped the progressives in their attempt
to wrest the power from the hands of the Queen’s
faction there was no peace between her and the Japanese.
But she was the pivotal point in the whole situation,
and this the Japanese failed to see, or, seeing, ignored.</p>

<p>As we have said, the Chinese were striving hard to
make up for the mistake which they had made in allowing
Korea to sign treaties on the basis of independence,
and with such good results that Japanese diplomacy was
again frustrated. Once more she had recourse to the
arm of force to carry out her ideas. The war with China
resulted in complete success for her arms and again Japanese
influence became paramount; but it should be
noted that this aroused little enthusiasm among the
Koreans. To be sure they had been saved from the
threatened Chinese supremacy but the Koreans had no
confidence in the ability of the Japanese to handle the
situation wisely. In this they were right, for Japan began
by enforcing unnecessary sumptuary laws which did not
strike at the root of the Korean difficulty but only
wounded the pride of the Korean people. At that time
Japan had a second opportunity to prove her ability to
handle an alien people and again she failed. The assassination
of the Queen and the enforced detention of the
King in is palace, which resulted in his throwing himself
into the arms of Russia, was the direct result.</p>

<p>This series of events convinced the Koreans that Japan
was unable to effect the changes which were necessary
in order to prepare for the real progress of the country,
and they also demonstrated to the Western world that
however capable Japan may have been in leading her
own people toward civilization and enlightenment she
lacked the peculiar power necessary to the handling of
an alien people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>As time went on and Russian prestige increased in
the peninsula it became evident that diplomacy would
again fail to save the situation and Japan was again
driven to arms. The result bids fair to be another Japanese
success. So far as Korea is concerned the situation
is much the same as it was at the close of the Japan-China
war. Japan is in a position to do about as she
pleases here. The question arises whether, during the
years that have elapsed since her former failures to
handle the Korean problem, she has gained the requisite
ability to do so. At the beginning of the present war she
concluded a special agreement with Korea by virtue of
which the latter gave her the right of way through
the peninsula for war purposes. Korea, on her side,
received the solemn pledge of Japan to uphold her independence
and to work for her welfare.</p>

<p>To review the successive steps of the policy which
Japan has pursued in Korea since the ratification of that
agreement is not a particularly agreeable task. It must
always be borne in mind that the Japanese are working
under a terrible strain. Hundreds of thousands of their
people are perishing on the battle field and millions of
treasure are being poured out to secure to the Japanese
nation a guarantee of continued existence. It is a life
and death struggle and when a man is in the midst of
such a struggle we do not expect from him the niceties of
courtesy which we should expect from him at other times.
There have been many criticisms of Japan’s course in
Korea during the past year. She is charged with having
done little or nothing to stem the tide of official corruption,
that she has not bent her energies to the bettering
of the condition of the common people, that nothing has
been effected in the line of currency reform. Whatever
may be the reasons for this it must appear to the unprejudiced
observer that the charges are substantially
true. We do not dare to say that Japan has no intention
of effecting these needed reforms and it may be that
there are cogent reasons why they could not be. Leaving
out of view what the intentions of the Japanese may
be and holding ourselves strictly to what has been actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
accomplished we are bound to admit that up to the
present time the results have been disappointing.</p>

<p>But the fact that the needed reforms have not been
instituted should not lead us to a wholesale condemnation
of the Japanese regime. The problem is an extremely
complicated one and those who expected that by a
single wave of the hand a condition of official corruption
that has been fostered and fed by centuries of precedent
could be rectified were doomed to disappointment from
the start.</p>

<p>But unfortunately both for Korea and for Japan the
failure to carry out reforms is only one, and the lesser
one at that, of the complaints that are heard. It is stated
from various parts of the country that Koreans are
being deprived of their property without receiving proper
compensation. Doubtless some of these stories are exaggerations
but enough of them have been witnessed by
foreigners of unquestioned veracity to establish the general
fact. What we wonder at is that in the midst of a
great war, in which all her energies are absorbed, Japan
should allow the already difficult Korean problem to become
complicated to such a painful degree by an influx
of the less desirable element of their people into the peninsula.
We hear it repeatedly asserted that the reinforcement
of Japan’s enormous army in Manchuria is gradually
depleting the supply of labor in Japan itself. This
must be so if something like a million young men have
been taken away to the seat of war. But if it is so how
does it come about that thousands upon thousands of
Japanese are flocking into Korea? It must be because they
consider their opportunities better here than in the home
country. But just at the present crisis they are doing
their own land a double injury, first by further depleting
the supply of labor there and secondly by complicating
the already sufficiently difficult Korean problem.</p>

<p>The Japanese authorities in Korea have repeatedly
been heard to say that a very undesirable class of Japanese
is pouring into this country. They are thoroughly
aware of this and they feel very keenly the extreme difficulty
of holding their nationals in check. What we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
wonder at is that the Japanese government, which has
shown such consummate ability in holding its subjects in
check in Japan should allow itself to become hampered
by the lawless acts of its subjects in Korea. It seems to
us, and in this we are simply voicing the general sentiment
of foreign observers in Korea, that the obvious
course would have been to prohibit promiscuous emigration
from Japan to Korea until the war was over and
adequate arrangements could be made for the management
and jurisdiction of those who wished to come.</p>

<p>Whether we are reasonable in this may be seen from
the following consideration. It is affirmed by the defenders
of Japan’s policy in Korea that as soon as the
war is over and things quiet down these acknowledged
difficulties will be overcome and the common people of
Korea will be protected in their rights. This sounds
reasonable, but does not every undesirable Japanese who
comes here before that time make that solution more difficult?
What, for instance of all the Koreans who have
been forced to sell their property for a mere fraction of
its value? Will the justice which Japan’s advocates foresee
be retroactive, and will those acts of injustice be rectified?
The Korean government guaranteed to secure the land
for the building of the great railway through the peninsula.
Was it not the duty of the Japanese to see to it
that this land was paid for by the Korean government
before it was seized, or at least should not each Korean
whose land was appropriated have received an official
paper signifying the amount of land he surrendered, such
paper constituting a claim on the government for payment
at some future time? Unless something like this
was done it is hard to see how any future action of the
Japanese could right the manifest wrong. The evidence
has been lost.</p>

<p>It seems to be an object of general surprise that
Japan should estimate at such a small value the good
will of the Korean people. It was not to be expected
that the government could look with satisfaction upon
a Japanese occupation, but at first the people were
enthusiastic over it and hailed it as a sign that all abuses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
were to be done away. We confess to utter inability to
understand how or why Japan should have sacrificed
this heavy asset of good will. It is the province of
diplomacy and statesmanship to make use of all such
moral factors to the fullest extent. We hear on all sides
the statement that the Koreans have brought the present
state of things upon themselves, but what we would
like to know is the reason why Japan has not only failed
to carry out needed reforms but has rendered future
work in this time almost impossible by allowing an
army of adventurers to come in and exasperate the
people. We can see only two possible answers, either
the Japanese government has concluded that reforms
will not pay or else they are not fully aware of the actual
conditions that prevail in Korea.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago at a station on the Seoul-Fusan
Railway a Korean stepped upon a path leading away
from the station. There was no sign to indicate that
this was forbidden. Instantly three or four Japanese
rushed upon him, knocked him down and beat him into
unconsciousness. He remained in that state two days
but finally recovered. It was an utterly brutal and causeless
assault, and this sort of thing is going on all over
the country. The class of Japanese who for the most
part are exploiting Korea seem to take delight in wantonly
abusing the people, simply out of braggadocio. There
is no use in multiplying examples of this. We think that
the Japanese are injuring themselves in allowing this sort
of thing to go on. We are sorry to see that Koreans
have come to the conclusion that all Japanese are like
this. Such is far from being the case. We believe the
average Japanese would act very different from this.
The daily press of Japan is constantly recording acts of
generosity and kindness on the part of Japanese even toward
Russian captives and we believe that if the more
respectable class of Japanese should come to Korea the
people would be treated justly and kindly.</p>

<p>We have consistently upheld Japan in her opposition
to Russian intrigues in the Far East. Japan is doing a
splendid work and is fitting herself to do a still greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
work in this region. She probably aspires to be a
leader of opinion in this part of the world and to bring
her influence to bear upon China for the renovation of
that enormous mass of humanity. That is a much larger
work than the mere absorption of a little corner of the
Far East like Korea; but if Japan breaks her solemn
pledges to Korea and continues to treat this people as
she is now doing she is sure to injure herself in the eyes
of the world. Japan is fighting Russia because of the
latter’s broken promises in Manchuria, but if Japan herself
breaks the promises she has made to Korea, how
can she gain the countenance and acquiescence of the
Western powers in any plan for large work in the rehabilitation
of China? The best thing for Japan from
the merely selfish standpoint would be to clear her skirts
of all suspicion of double dealing with Korea, to give this
people even-handed justice, to visit swift and exemplary
punishment on any Japanese subject who treats a Korean
less justly than he would a fellow Japanese.</p>

<p>We would ask what Korea has done that her people
should be despoiled of their property and debarred from
ordinary justice. To be sure she has not responded to
the appeal which Japan made so many years ago and
still retains the forms of conservation, but this can hardly
be called crime. If Korea had been leagued with
Russia against Japan and had been conquered by the
latter then Japan would have some semblance of right to
absorb the territory of the peninsula, but this was not
the case. Of her own accord Japan formed an alliance
with Korea and engaged to preserve the interests of the
country. A failure to carry out this agreement would
throw suspicion upon all Japan’s policy regarding the
territory she acquires during the present war and would
make it difficult to believe any of her promises.</p>

<p>A man who is prominent in the Japanese <i>regime</i> told
us flatly a few days ago that as soon as this war is over
Japan would declare a protectorate over this country.
The excuse seems to be that it has been found impossible
to make anything out of the Korean government or to
effect reforms. This is the merest subterfuge. No serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
attempt has been made to effect reforms, no one stands
in the way of reforms, the people have been waiting for
them and hoping against hope that reforms would be
instituted, but so far as reforming this government for
the sake of the Korean people is concerned there are few
signs of a desire or determination to do so. Russia was
severely blamed for making use of corrupt officials to
carry out her schemes in Korea but we find today that
Japanese are doing the very same thing in some parts of the
country. We do not believe the leading authorities in
Japan are aware of all the facts in the case and we cannot
believe that they would countenance such a close
imitation of Russian methods. What is needed is that
the facts should be known. If they are known there are
those who will attempt to have the evils remedied.</p>

<p>Our attitude, and that of most foreigners in Korea,
is one of admiration of Japan’s wonderful ability and of
earnest desire for the real welfare of the people. We want
to see Japan’s military and naval record equalled by a
wise and broad-minded solution of the Korean problem,
a solution that will secure to Japan all the legitimate
fruits of victory and still ensure to Koreans immunity
from unjust reprisals.</p>

<h2 id="A_Visit_to_Quelpart">A Visit to Quelpart.</h2>

<p>There appeared in the Korean Repository in 1899 an interesting
article on the island of Quelpart by Rev. A. A. Pieters,
one of the few foreigners who have visited that place.</p>

<p>As a rule we hesitate to use our pages for the reproduction
of material once published, but we believe that
comparatively few of the readers of this <span class="smcap">Review</span> saw that
article and the subject is such an interesting one that we
venture to reprint it here.</p>

<p>The island of Quelpart, or as Rev. W. E. Griffis, D.D.
in his book on Korea calls it—the Sicily of Korea, or as
Koreans call it, Chai-joo, is the largest island of the Korean
archipelago and is situated south of the peninsula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
at a distance of some fifty miles from the mainland. The
shape of the island is elliptical, and straight lines drawn
between the two farthest and two nearest points thro
the center would be forty and seventeen miles long. As
you approach the island from the north at a distance of
twenty miles it looks like an isosceles, the two sides rising
at an angle of about seventeen degrees and only near
the top turning a little steeper—something like Namsan
as you look at it from the north gate of Seoul. The island
rises gradually all round from the edges toward the
center where the foot of Mount Auckland, or Hal-la-san,
is planted.</p>

<p>All over the island are scattered small conical hills,
which look very insignificant before the cloudy peak of
Hal-la-san rising to the height of 6,558 feet. The origin
of the island is decidedly volcanic, the mountain being
most probably an extinct volcano. The flow of lava was
toward the north and south-southwest, the streams being,
the first, some twenty miles wide along the coast of
the island and the second, some thirty miles. Thus the
lava covered two-fifths of the whole area of the island.
This part of it is very stony and very difficult to cultivate
and gigantic labor must have been spent in trying to
clear the fields of the innumerable stones. Often on a field
of one acre there will be four or five piles of stone eight or
ten feet high. Another way of disposing of these stones
was to build walls between the fields, so that from the
top of one of the small hills the land seems to be covered
with a large irregular net. The other three-fifths of the
island are almost free from stones and the soil is black and
rich. The mountain slopes gradually towards the east
and the west, but comes down abruptly in deep ravines
towards the south and especially towards the north.</p>

<p>On the top of the mountain there is a small, round
lake and at the bottom of one of the ravines another
large lake. The first one is probably the old crater filled
with water from the melting snow. We were told that
ice lies on the top until June, altho the climate on the
island is so warm that cabbage grows all winter in the
open air. When we were there, towards the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
February, the grass in some places was four inches high
and on the southern coast flowers were blooming. In
spite of that a third of the mountain was covered with
deep snow which would make all attempts to climb to
the top useless. All the mountains as well as the hills to
the east of it are covered with thick woods of oak. In
these forests deer, wild hogs, hares and other animals
abound but there are no tigers or bears. The hills that
have no trees on them, are covered with the peculiar
short Korean grass which makes such fine lawns. This
grass is much prettier in Quelpart than anywhere on the
mainland and often one comes across natural lawns four
or five hundred yards square, with not a weed on them
and all covered as with a heavy velvet carpet. The coast
of Quelpart is devoid of harbors or any shelters, rocky,
and the numerous small islands which are scattered so
thickly all along the southern and western coast of
Korea are absent here.</p>

<p>This absence of shelter together with the constant
strong winds makes navigation very difficult.</p>

<p>One is surprised at the absence of streams and springs.
On making our trip around the island we came across
only two streams, and that after a whole week of rains.
While there are some powerful springs in the city of Chai-joo,
in the other two magistracies there are no springs
nor any wells and the people have to use rain water
gathered in artificial ponds. Where the water from the
melting show on the mountain goes is a mystery.</p>

<p>As I above mentioned there are three magistracies on
the island: Chai-Joo on the northern coast, the capital
and the seat of the Governor (Mok-sa). Tai-Chung on
the southwest coast and Chung Ui in the east part of the
island. All the three cities are walled. Chai Joo counts
some twelve hundred houses, Tai-chung, four hundred,
and Chung Ui three hundred. The distance from Chai
Joo to Tai Chung is ninety <i>li</i>, from there to Chung Ui a
hundred and thirty <i>li</i>, and from Chung Ui to Chai Joo
seventy <i>li</i>. Until the war the island belonged to Chul-lado:
soon after the war it was made independent, and
again when Korea was divided into thirteen provinces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Quelpart was put under the jurisdiction of the Governor
(Quan-chul-sa) of South Chul-la-do. On the whole island
there are said to be about a hundred villages and some
hundred thousand people. These figures are given by
the Koreans and of course are probably not quite true.
All the villages lie either along the coast where the people
can raise some rice or at the foot and along the sides of
the mountain where fuel is plentiful and where Irish
potatoes grow very well. The space between the shore
and the foot of the mountain is not populated and long
stretches of rich soil lie uncultivated. Only those woods
and fields that are near the towns and larger villages have
owners. All the rest of the island belongs to nobody
and anyone may come and cut the trees or cultivate the
ground. An oxload of wood which a man has to bring
on his ox for ten or fifteen miles is sold in the cities for
twelve cents. Of the cereals raised on the island millet
takes the first place, and this is the main article of diet.
Rice is a luxury and is eaten only by well-to-do people in
the cities. In the villages the people never use it. This is
on account of the scarceness of rice fields, of which there
are only a few along the coast. The little rice there is
mostly brought from the mainland. Besides millet, rice
and Irish potatoes, the people raise barley, wheat, buckwheat,
beans, sweet potatoes, tobacco, vegetables and a
few other less important cereals. Of fruits peaches, oranges
and pomeloes are the only things that grow there.
Of animal food the islanders, like the people of the mainland,
eat very little. It consists of beef, horse and
dog meat, pork, game, fish and pearl oysters. Crabs,
common oysters and all the different kinds of clams that
are so plentiful on the southern and western coast of
Korea are absent in the Quelpart waters. Owing to the
rocky bottom of the sea very little, if any, net fishing is
done and the fish are mostly caught with hooks. For
going out into the sea to fish, boats are not employed.
Instead of them people go out on small rafts made of
some ten short logs with a platform built a foot above
them to which an our is fastened. Instead of the tiny
little frames not more than eight inches long, used by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
fisherman on the mainland for fastening the string, the
Quelpart fisherman uses regular rods made of bamboo
some twelve feet long, and lack of fish, clams, etc., is
supplied by the abundance of pearl oysters and seaweed,
which are both used on the island and exported. The
pearl oysters are very large some measuring ten inches in
diameter, and very fleshy. Unlike other oysters, it has
only one shell, which is often used by the Koreans as an
ash tray and from which mother of pearl is obtained.
Covered with this shell as with a roof the oyster lives
fastened to a rock. Its meat is considered a luxurious
dish and one oyster costs as much as six cents on the island.
Pearls are but very seldom found in the oysters.
For export the oysters are torn out of the shell; the intestine
bag cut off, the meat cleaned, dried and strung on
thin sticks. Altho white when fresh the color changes
to a dark red, like that of a dried apricot. They can be
seen displayed in the native grocery shops in Seoul, flat
reddish disks about four inches in diameter fastened by
tens with a thin stick stuck thro them.</p>

<p>Of the seaweeds there are several different kinds: some
of them are used as fertilizers, some are used for food and
some are sold to the Japanese for making carbonate of
soda. The first kind is gathered on the seashore, but
the other two have to be obtained from the bottom of
the sea. It is strange to say that the diving for these
weeds as well as for the pearl oysters is entirely done by
women. Dressed in a kind of bathing suit with a sickle in
one hand and a gourd with bag tied to it in front of them,
they swim out from the shore as far as half a mile: boats
cannot be afforded and they dive, probably a depth of forty
or fifty feet, to the bottom, cut the weeds with the sickle,
or if they find a pearl oyster, tear it off from the stone,
and then put it into the bag which is kept floating by the
gourd. They do not go back before the bag is filled,
which often takes more than half an hour. Altho they
are magnificent swimmers, one cannot help admiring their
endurance, when he thinks that this work is begun in
February. Of late Japanese supplied with diving apparatus,
have been coming to Quelpart and catching all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the pearl oysters, so that the poor women have to be
satisfied with the weeds only. The magistrates told us
that these Japanese never asked for permission nor paid
anything for catching the pearl oysters. If it is so, the
imposition upon the weak Koreans is surprising.</p>

<p>The Quelpart women not only dive for weeds and oysters
but do the largest part of all work. Even ox loads of
grain are brought to the city market for sale by women.
The carrying of the water is done entirely by the women,
who have often to go a long distance to fetch it. For
carrying the water they use broad low pitchers set in a
basket, which is fastened with strings around the shoulders
and carried on the back. I never saw this done anywhere
else in Korea as it is considered very disgraceful
for a woman to carry anything on her back. I was told
by the Koreans whom we had with us, that if on the
mainland a man made his wife to do so he would be
driven out of the village. Native hats, hair bands and
skull-caps, which are extensively manufactured on the
island are also mostly made by women. In fact the women
of Quelpart might be called the Amazonians of
Korea. They not only do all the work but greatly exceed
the men in number, and on the streets one meets three
women to one man. This is because so many men are
away sailing. The women are more robust and much better
looking than their sisters on the mainland. As almost
everything is done by the women, there remains
nothing else for the men to do but to loaf, and to do
them credit they do it well. Except for a shop here and
there in which a man is presiding with a long pipe in his
mouth, it is very difficult to find a man doing anything.
For this, however, they are not any better off, as all the
islanders seem to be strikingly poor. Not only the food,
but the clothes and houses are much worse than on the
mainland. Dog skins are extensively used for making
clothes. Hats, the shape of a tea-cup, overcoats, leggings,
like those worn by the Chinese, and stockings are
all made of dog skin with the hair outside, which for
greater warmth are used untanned. A suit of such
clothes is handed down from generation to generation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and the smell of it is far from being sweet.
The women’s clothes as well the men’s trousers and
shirts are made of native or Manchester sheeting. To
make the sheeting stronger they dip it into the juice pressed
out of some kind of a wild persimmon. This makes
it a dirty brown color, which saves the trouble of washing
it. The cloth is thus worn until it falls to pieces.
Besides skin hats the men also use felt hats of the same
shape as those worn by the Seoul chair coolies, only
much larger, the brims measuring more than two feet in
diameter. The one exception in respect of clothes is made
by the people in the magistracies who wear the same
white clothes and black hats as the people on the mainland.</p>

<p>The houses consist of one six foot room and an open
kitchen. The walls, ceiling and floor of the room are bare,
and the floor has no flues for heating it. Instead of this
a large hole is dug in the floor of the kitchen and in the
cold weather a fire is kept there day and night. Around
this fire they eat, work, and sleep. This again is different
in the cities where the houses are much the same as on
the mainland. All the houses with a few exceptions are
thatched. On account of the strong winds the thatch is
fastened by a net of straw ropes two inches thick and
eight inches apart.</p>

<p>The needs of the people for things outside of their
own products seem to be so small that a few shops supply
them all. In the capital, Chai-Joo, there are some
eight small shops; in Tai-Chung one; and in Chung-Ui
perhaps one. These are probably the only shops on the
whole island and from them the people obtain the few
needed foreign articles, such as shirting, dyes, thread,
needles, nails, etc. The periodical markets which are held
on the mainland and in all the towns and many villages
every five days, are altogether absent, and on the whole
trading seems to be yet in its infancy. The things exported
from Quelpart are pearl oyster, seaweed, native
medicine, cosmetic oil, horse and cow hides, horses and
cattle. The cosmetic oil is pressed from the seeds of the
fruit of the <i>Ditnea Strawmium</i> or, as the Koreans call it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
<i>Tang Paik</i>. This tree grows abundantly all over the
southern part of the island. It is evergreen and blooms
in February with beautiful crimson flowers. On the mainland
this tree is very rare.</p>

<h2 id="The_Magic_Ox-Cure">The Magic Ox-Cure.</h2>

<p>A wealthy country gentleman, whom we will call Mr.
Cho, tiring of the <i>otium cum dignitate</i> of provincial life and
wishing to throw himself into the vortex of official activity,
came up to Seoul and became the ante-room
loafer and flatterer in general to one of the highest dignitaries
in the land. Morning and evening he inquired assiduously
after his patron’s health and backed up his words
with frequent and costly gifts. Of course this began to
tell upon his finances and after ten years of perseverance
he received word from his family in the country that he
was bankrupt and that as his household were about to
die of starvation they must write and let him know.</p>

<p>This disclosure aroused Mr. Cho to violent anger
against the official who had so long accepted his gifts
with complacency but had never suggested any equivalent
in the shape of a government position. He hurried
to the official’s house and explained that as his
property was all gone be must return to his shattered
home and his starving family.</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied the official. “Of course you will
consult your own convenience.” This made Cho’s anger
burn seven times hot. He stalked from the room and
posted to his country place vowing that he would find
some way to bring the unfeeling official to terms.</p>

<p>Arrived at his ancestral village he found that his
family had given up the spacious mansion he had formerly
owned and were living, or rather dying, in a wretched
straw-thatched hovel. It was necessary to raise some
money, and so he started out for a distant town where
his fourth cousin lived, in order to negotiate a small loan.</p>

<p>As he was on his way he was overtaken by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
severe storm. He looked all about but could see no shelter
anywhere. He struggled on, looking to right and left
through the pouring rain, and at last sighted a little cottage
among the trees. At the door he called out to the
good-man of the house but there was no reply. The
house was not deserted, for he saw a thin line of smoke
issuing from the chimney. He shouted aloud and at last
an old woman appeared at the door and questioned who
it was that thus rudely demanded entrance, though uninvited.
When the bedraggled Cho explained the situation
the woman relented and let him in. There was
but one stone-floored room but this she gave up to him
with good grace and went about preparing him a nice
supper, after which he lay down and fell asleep.</p>

<p>How long he had slept he could not tell, when he
awoke with a start to the sound of a man’s voice who
was asking of the woman gruffly:</p>

<p>“What time is it, anyway? I must get off to market
early with that ox”; whereupon the couple entered Cho’s
room, the man carrying four sticks and the wife a halter.
The farmer dragged the bedclothes off the guest, bestrode
his chest and began to belabor him with the sticks,
while the woman fastened the halter around his neck.
He was then dragged out of the room, but to his horror
he found himself going on four legs and when he tried
to speak he could only low like an ox. When one of his
horns caught against the door-post he learned that he
had indeed been transformed into a four-footed beast and
was being taken to market. To say that he was experiencing
a new sensation would be to put it very mildly
indeed.</p>

<p>At the market town he was herded with a drove of
cattle, among which he was the largest and fattest, and
consequently there were many eager buyers; but the
farmer asked such a high price that none of them could
buy. At last a burly butcher came to terms with the
farmer and poor Mr. Cho found that he was being led
away to slaughter.</p>

<p>But as fate would have it, the butcher was of a bibulous
temperament and when they came to a wine shop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the ox was tied to a stake while the butcher indulged in
the flowing bowl. And so copiously did the latter drink
that he forgot all about the animal. Mr. Cho stood waiting
for hours but his master did not appear. Just over
the hedge to the right was a field of succulent turnips.
To the bovine nostrils of Mr. Cho this proved as
tempting as the wine had proved to the butcher.</p>

<p>Mr. Cho had a ring through his nose which was very
awkward but at last he managed to get loose from the
stake and, crowding through the hedge, he pulled a turnip
and began to munch it. After the first bite a curious
sensation overtook him and he began to have an over-mastering
desire to stand on his hind legs only. A
thrill went through him from tail to horns and in another
instant he found himself an ox no longer but the
same old two-legged Cho as of old. This was eminently
satisfactory and the satisfaction was doubled when, coming
through the hedge into the road, a befuddled butcher
asked him if he had seen a loose ox anywhere. He assured
the purveyor of beef that he had not, and walked
away toward home pondering upon this rather unusual
occurrence.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stood stock still in the road, uttered
an exclamation of triumph, slapped his thigh and hurried
forward with his mind evidently made up.</p>

<p>“Sticks and turnips! Sticks and turnips!” he repeated
over and over again as if it were a magic formula. He
kept straight on till night overtook him near the very
house which had witnessed his metamorphosis. He
called out again as before and was similarly received,
but instead of sleeping, he arose in the night and sneaked
about the premises until he found and secured the four
sticks with which the work had been done. He followed
this larceny with a silent and speedy departure, not toward
his home but toward Seoul, still muttering in
his beard,</p>

<p>“Sticks and turnips! Sticks and turnips!”</p>

<p>Of course he knew the ins and outs of the official’s house
which he had haunted for ten long fruitless years, and as
it was summer time and very hot all the windows were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
open. So he had no difficulty in marking down his prey.
He found him sleeping profoundly. Cho knelt beside
the recumbent form and taking only two of the sticks
began tapping very gently upon the sleeper, but not hard
enough to awaken him. By the dim light of the moon he
soon saw two horns grow out of the sleeper’s head and
his two hands gradually turn into hoofs. This was
enough. He arrested the operation at this point and
silently departed.</p>

<p>When morning came there were hurryings to and fro
and whispered consultations in that high official’s house.
A celebrated physician came hurrying up in his two man
chair and disappeared within the house. On a distant
hill a devil shrine awoke to life at the howlings and twistings
of a <i>mudang</i> who was begging the imps in frenzied
terms to lift their heavy hands from the person of a high
official.</p>

<p>But there was no relief. The great man sat there
dumb as a brute with two great horns protruding from
his forehead and his two hands turned into horny hoofs.</p>

<p>At this juncture Mr. Cho appeared upon the scene,
announcing that he had just come from the country, and
when told of the terrible affliction of his former patron
expressed the utmost concern. Admitted to the chamber
of the official he inquired what had been done for him.
He learned that physicians had exhausted their skill and
that, at the instance of the lady of the house, <i>mudangs</i>
had done their best but all to no avail.</p>

<p>Mr. Cho assumed a mysterious air and asserted
that there was one remedy that had been left untried and
that he was sure it would prove effective. He promised
to secure some of it and hurried away. Purchasing a
turnip at the corner grocery he cut it up fine, macerated
it and dried it into a powder. Late in the afternoon he
returned to the official’s house and in the presence of the
family administered the potent drug. An instant later
the two horns were seen to recede slowly into the cranium
of the patient and the hoofs to change their form,
and at last all evidence of the bestial metamorphosis
was wiped out. The official’s voice came back and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
joined with the rest of the family in heaping thanks upon
Mr. Cho. But if anyone supposes that his reward ended
with mere thanks he will make a grievous mistake.
Honors poured in upon him, <i>peysil</i> unlimited and <i>kwansey</i>
without alloy.</p>

<h2 id="The_Seoul-Fusan_Railway">The Seoul-Fusan Railway.</h2>

<p>The completion of this important line of communication
is an event of international importance, for it marks
a definite period in the construction of a through line
that will connect Fusan with the whole of Europe. The
trip from Tokyo to London will then require but a few
hours of sea travel. The Korean Straits and the Straits
of Dover are the Eastern and Western sea barriers which
separate the two Island Empires from the great continent.
To think that only a few miles of track require to
be laid before this stupendous piece of work is completed
is almost enough to take one’s breath away. A few
years ago it was laughed at as being the dream of a
fanatic. Today it is an accomplished fact. The dreams
of yesterday are the realities of today.</p>

<p>The formal opening of this branch of the through line
called for appropriate ceremonies. No other one thing has
done so much to strengthen Japan’s hold upon the peninsula,
and the way Japan has poured money into Korea
to complete it shows how confident she was of ultimate
victory in this present conflict. Of all known things
capital is the most timid, and the unreservedness with
which money was handed out for this purpose is a
measure of Japan’s confidence in herself.</p>

<p>For weeks before the opening ceremonies took place
the broad space acquired by the railway for terminal
facilities outside the South Gate of Seoul was being prepared
for the occasion. Enormous arches of evergreen
were erected, a score of temporary buildings of various
kinds were put up. The steep hill to the east was laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
out with care and many forms of curious and beautiful
ornamentation were devised to please and interest the
guests of the occasion.</p>

<p>In honour of this occasion Prince Fushimi came from
Japan to act as chairman of the opening ceremony.
He is the son of Prince Fushimi who has lately been
travelling in America. In preparation for his coming, the
city went through a species of Spring house-cleaning
and all the main thoroughfares were covered with a thick
coating of fresh red sand.</p>

<p>On the momentous day a large company gathered
about nine o’clock in the morning. Special trains had
been run from Fusan and Chemulpo and besides the
great number of Japanese and Korean officials there
were upwards of fifty Europeans and Americans present.
Gathered under a spacious awning the company had not
long to wait before the exercises began. On the platform,
Prince Fushimi for Japan and Prince Eui Yang for Korea
occupied the places of honor. Various addresses were
made in Japanese and in Korean and the Prince declared
the railway open. Hon. H. N. Allen made an appropriate
speech in English. It was partly reminiscent in character
and carried his hearers back to the time when even between
Seoul and Chemulpo there was nothing more than
a bridle-path.</p>

<p>After the formal exercises were over the audience
were treated to excellent samples of Japanese histrionic
art. Poems were acted in character and though the
words were lost upon some of the audience the acting
was fully appreciated.</p>

<p>About eleven o’clock an elaborate banquet was served
in a long pavilion where one thousand guests were seated.
After this was concluded and the toasts had been drunk
the guests wandered about the extensive grounds and
listened to the excellent music discoursed by the Imperial
Korean Band, or examined the curious objects of interest
which had been prepared by the hosts. In one part of
the grounds a company of jugglers drew the attention of
many of the guests and in another part trained Japanese
wrestlers were exhibiting their skill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the guests dispersed, but only
to return in the evening and witness the fine display of
fire-works, which closed with several set pieces of great
beauty.</p>

<p>Among the guests of the company was Mr. E. W.
Frazar of Yokohama, the head of Frazar and Co. who
furnished the line with a large part of the rails and the
rolling stock. He is the son of Everett Frazar who was
for so many years the Consul-general for Korea in New
York. He expressed himself with great satisfaction over
the fact that the Japanese had adopted the American
system throughout, in their Korean railways, contrasting
it with the heterogeneous system found in Japan
itself.</p>

<p>The guests from Fusan were enthusiastic over the
new 120 ton Baldwin engines that are being put on the
road and over the fact that soon we shall see a nine-hour
schedule between Fusan and Seoul. This will be an
average of thirty miles an hour including stops. The
road bed, the bridges, the culverts and tunnels are all of
the most substantial character and do great credit to the
constructors.</p>

<p>It is asserted that the traffic on this road is already
quite considerable and that the Koreans are taking advantage
of it very freely. The influence of such an artery
of traffic and travel cannot but be immense. It will almost
surely cause great changes in former methods, and
during the period of readjustment it may be that more or
less hardship may be caused. But this is incident to all
great improvements and the ultimate results must be
highly beneficial to all such Koreans as have energy and
ability to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>

<p>When we think of the enormous appreciation of land
values all along the line we feel as if Koreans ought to
inaugurate a campaign of education, to make their countrymen
aware of this enhancement of value and to urge
them to make the most of it rather than sell to the
first bidder who offers them a ten per cent rise upon the
original value of the land. If a bag of rice formerly cost
nearly its full original value to get it to market, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
now it will cost only a few cents to do so, it is plain that
farm land has nearly if not quite doubled in value. But
there are other factors at work as well, which enhance
the value of land, and unless the Korean is apprised
of this he is likely to sell for much less than his land is
worth.</p>

<p>Whatever sentimental notions one may have about
the Koreans it is quite certain that the Japanese have
come here to stay and they come with money, ready to
buy liberally. One of the most important problems in
sight, therefore, is that of the future of those Koreans
who elect to sell their fields. They are not accustomed
to handle large sums of money and it looks as if there
would be considerable danger of their suffering loss.
Koreans should be exhorted to hold on to their property
at least until they have clearly decided what to do next.</p>

<p>The Koreans will have to learn by hard experience
just as the Japanese themselves did between 1868 and
1880. The stories that are told of old worn-out steam-ships
sold to the Japanese at high figures in those days
would fill a small volume. The Korean must also learn
by his failures. We believe that in this school he will
develop a fair degree of ability to take care of himself. It
will take time and there will be many unpleasant experiences
in the process, but it is certain that he is now
“up against” a genuine business proposition and unless
he can bring to bear upon the situation a keenness and
an energy proportionate to that of the Japanese he will
go to the wall.</p>

<p>All we ask is that the Korean be given a fair chance.
If he is given an opportunity to obtain redress in case he
is treated in an illegal manner the rest may safely be left
to his native genius. But what he surely should receive
from the Japanese is a “square deal.” If this is denied
him of course he will have nothing left but to succumb
or rebel.</p>

<p>In spite of many cases of injustice which have been
reported we still believe that as soon as the war is over
Japan will put forth strenuous and successful efforts to
govern the unruly element among her nationals in Korea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
She may proclaim a protectorate over the country
and temporarily impair its independence. This
will be contrary to her express promises but there will
be no one to make a successful protest and it may be
that in time events will so shape themselves that Korea
may again be given an autonomous position. Meanwhile
there are important lessons of industry and
thrift for the Korean to learn and upon his success in
learning them will depend in large part the recovery of
his political autonomy.</p>

<h2 id="Editorial_Comment">Editorial Comment.</h2>

<p>The great event of the month has been the crowning
victory of the Japanese over the Russian fleet. The
details of the fight are now at hand and enough is
known to demonstrate that the Russian fleet was a mere
man of straw, to be blown over by the first wind. When
we think of the tons of printers ink that have been expended
upon a minute description of every movement of
this doomed armada from the time it left the Baltic Sea
until it was swept away like a mere cob-web by the Japanese
navy there seems to be a grim humor about the
whole thing. It was a tragic comedy! The thought of
the doomed men who went down in this forlorn hope is
inexpressibly sad. They were trying to do their duty as
they saw it; but when we look at this event as a war
measure and see how totally the Russians misconceived
of the prowess and the skill of the Japanese we can only
say that Russia is lacking in the first essential of war—a
knowledge of the forces that she must contend against.</p>

<p>The Japanese command of the sea is now assured so
far as Russia is concerned and this will put an end to all
speculation as to whether Japan will be permitted to
carry out her plans in Korea unmolested. This is a severe
disappointment to many Koreans but it may prove best
for the peninsula after all. After the strain and stress of
war has been removed and the Japanese authorities have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
time to examine the Korean question in all its bearings,
it is reasonable to hope that they will see fit to arrange
for the proper jurisdiction of their people in this country.
In spite of the views of some extremists we believe that
affairs may be so arranged here that the latter state of
Korea and of Koreans will be better than the former one.</p>

<p>We see from the <i>Times</i> of London that Dr. Morrison’s
recent brief visit to Korea led him to make such optimistic
statements, that that influential periodical judges
Japan’s work in Korea to be superior to the work of
England in Egypt. But we would like to inquire what
Japan has done for the common people of Korea that is
any way comparable with England’s work for the Fellahin
of Egypt. We would not for a moment disparage
the splendid work that Japan has done along the line of
railway construction and of general trade in Korea but
when anyone reports the condition of affairs here in such
terms that England’s peaceful achievement’s in Egypt and
India seem to be thrown into the shade, then we are
compelled to interpose a decided negative. Are the people
of Egypt governed better than before the English
occupation? Incomparably better. But the Koreans
are governed no better than before, if as well. The great
public works put through solely for the benefit of the
people of Egypt have absolutely no counterpart whatever
in this country. The railway was a war measure
which will benefit the people of Korea, but such help was
a secondary consideration entirely.</p>

<p>One good result of this great victory is that the
state of harrowing uncertainty in which the more conservative
officials of Korea were plunged has been cleared
up. They know now definitely who their masters are to
be and they can prepare as best they may to accept the
inevitable with good grace.</p>

<p>There are so many rumors circulating that one
can hardly put confidence in the statement of any
proposed reform in Korea until after the actual
event, but we hope that there is more than the
ordinary amount of truth in the report that Japanese
police are to be stationed in each of the prefectures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Korea. If this means a court of appeal to which Koreans
can bring cases of ill treatment with some hope of redress, a
very important step in advance will have been taken.
Whatever happens to the official ranks of Korea, we
protest that the common people should be left unmolested
and that their personal liberty and their property
rights should not only not be impaired but, under the
influence of the more enlightened power of Japan, they
should be more carefully preserved than they ever have
been under purely native control. American sympathy for
Japan is based upon the belief that Japan stands for the
“square deal,” and Americans believe the justice of Japan’s
contention in this present war is based upon Russia’s
departure from this principle. Whatever America’s good
will may or may not mean to Japan, it will be lost if in
the flush of victory the latter should take undue advantage
of their power to despoil the Korean people of their
territory either by seizure or by forced sale. Such acts
have been going on all about us, but it is the hope of
Japan’s well-wishers that the Japanese authorities will
repudiate such actions and put themselves on record as
being unalterably determined to give the common people
of this country a “square deal.”</p>

<p>The appearance on June 3rd of the first number of
the weekly <i>Seoul Press</i> is a matter on which foreign residents
in Seoul and every other portion of Korea should
be congratulated. It is published by the firm known as
the Seoul Press of which Mr. J. W. Hodge is the manager.
No intimation is given in the first number as to the personnel
of the management of this weekly but we are
pleased to learn from the editorial column that “Our
little paper will be run on a strictly honest and independent
basis, and will be the tool of no particular party,
but maintain itself on sound journalistic lines and principles.”
The editor invites all who are of a literary
turn of mind to make use of his columns and to endeavor
to make the paper a success. We trust that our new contemporary
will not be disappointed in his plan and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
he will have the hearty support of the reading, the writing
and the advertising portions of our foreign community.</p>

<p>We feel sure that this publication will meet a very
decided need in our community and the fact that it
is not a party organ nor committed to any faction makes
it doubly valuable. We shall expect to see facts published,
whoever may be pleased or displeased thereby. Almost
all the news that foreign papers in Japan get about
Korea is taken from the reports in native papers, from
Japanese reporters in Korea. They thus get but one
side of the story. The world wants to know what is
being <i>done</i> in Korea not mere statements of plans and
theories. Every effort which the Japanese authorities or
private citizens put forth for the benefit of the Korean
people should be clearly and fully stated and full acknowledgement
should be made, and if there are evils which
need to be remedied they should be, in a kindly way,
brought to the notice of the public so that an intelligent
opinion can be formed as to the exact situation here.
Public opinion is a mighty agency either for good or ill,
but the only way it can be legitimately used is by feeding
it upon cold, hard facts. That is what makes the difference
between public opinion in England, and in Russia.
So we hope that this new periodical will hunt assiduously
for facts, and give them to us. We would rather
have one column of facts about Korea than ten columns
of clippings from abroad. For this reason we are pleased
to see that the management of the <i>Seoul Press</i> intends
to increase gradually its staff of reporters and correspondents
throughout the peninsula.</p>

<p>We wish this journalistic venture all success. The
past ten years of Korean history are strewn with wrecks
of similar ventures but we trust the time has now come
when something permanent can be undertaken; and
when in about 1970 the citizens of Seoul look over the
back files of the <i>Seoul Press</i>, which will then be in its sixty-fifth
year, they will say with pride “This is the first genuine
foreign newspaper in Korea.”</p>

<p>The Home Department has written to all the provinces to the effect
that many of the laws are being disobeyed and people without means
of livelihood are wandering about the country accompanying powerful
Koreans or foreigners and tempting young people to sell or pawn their
rice fields or other property, generally in secret and then spend the
proceeds in riotous living. These debts have finally been collected of
parents or brothers by force, and these innocent parties complain that
their property is taken from them without cause. It is a shameful
state of affairs, and hereafter a father will not be compelled to pay the
debts of his son, and the son cannot sell the fields of his father. Any
one charged with this offence in future will be severely punished and
the governors are asked to notify all the magistrates.</p>

<p>Early in the month it was reported that the Russian soldiers in
northern Korea had exhausted all their funds and were demanding both
money and rice from every village.</p>

<p>The Il Chin Hoi in Chin Ju district expelled eighteen members and

Korea have been ordered from the Printing Bureau by the Japanese
government.</p>

<p>While here several members of the Japanese House of Commons
visited the Justice Court and city jail.</p>

<p>Yi Yang Pak, of Euiju, has been executed, having been charged
with injuring the military telegraph lines.</p>

<p>The Yang Chung prefect says the Japanese railway authorities have
demanded of him five hundred men to work thirty days each on the
railway line. He finds it difficult to get fifty men for ten days, during
this season of the year, and thinks the people should not be robbed of
their time for plowing and weeding their fields.</p>

the foreigners of various nationalities in Korea with the substantial
character behind Japanese commercial enterprises in Korea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The governor of South Choong Chung asks the Home Department
what disposition to make of the request of the Japanese army that he
shall report concerning all the horses in the province.</p>

by the Foreign Office to return to Seoul. A reply has been received that

<p>The governor of North Pyeng An province reports to the Foreign
Office that the prefect of Kang Kai has received a demand from the

the difficulty in securing the oxen and the hardship imposed on the
people during the cultivation season.</p>

<p>All the French Legation Guards have departed from Seoul with
the exception of four who remain to look after the Russian Legation
property.</p>

<p>In Juksau district about one hundred evil characters have gathered
under the name Righteous Army and have been squeezing money and
rice. The magistrate reported that his efforts to arrest them had failed
because each had a gun and ammunition.</p>

<p>The government has asked that the following be inserted in the
agreement between the Japanese and Korean Communication Departments:</p>

<p>1. All officers appointed must be Koreans.</p>

<p>2. Salaries of officers must be paid by Korean Finance Department.</p>

<p>3. Korean postage stamps must be used.</p>

<p>4. The duration of this agreement must be settled.</p>

<p>On the first of May the contract for communication service between
Korea and Japan was published in the Official Gazette.</p>

<p>From his country residence Mr. Min Yeng Kui, Minister of the
Finance Department, sent in his resignation, but it was not accepted.</p>

<p>The Minister of Finance has been requested to allow the free and
uninterrupted circulation of Japanese bank notes, without regard to the
condition of the Korean market.</p>

<p>One night recently many valuable jewels and several thousand yen
were taken from the home of one of the leading Ministers in the Korean
government. Thorough investigation revealed a trusted servant as the
guilty party. The goods were returned, and after a lecture in which he
was reminded that according to the law of the land he should be imprisoned,
the man was given a handsome present and dismissed from service.</p>

<p>The Home Department has asked the War Department to despatch
soldiers to Choong Chung province to hasten the dispersal of robber
bands.</p>

<p>Ten thousand boxes of gunpowder for the use of the British mines

school must be punished.</p>

<p>The German Minister has requested the government to remove the
granite blocks from the compound of the new German Legation being
erected outside the West Gate of Seoul, and he also asks that the
stones be used in the repair of the city wall in that vicinity.</p>

of the Communication agreement so that all officials and postage
stamps be put under the control of the Korean government, but the
proposition has been refused by the Japanese.</p>

style, debates and several unique races were features of the day’s outing.</p>

<p>The Vice Minister of the War Department, Mr. Om Chu-ik, has
resigned and his resignation has been accepted.</p>

<p>More than one hundred post office clerks are said to have been
ordered from Japan to Korea to assist in the new postal work undertaken
by the Japanese.</p>

<p>The regulations requiring examinations in order to secure appointment
to any of the Departments, include the Chinese language (reading
and composition) international history and international law. Only
thirty may pass the examination at one time and the first thirty have
already been passed and have received their appointments.</p>

<p>The Korean Minister in Washington telegraphs the Foreign Department
that Korean immigrants in Hawaii desire a Consul of their own
nationality instead of a Japanese subject.</p>

<p>When the Japanese officials took possession of the postoffices on
the seventeenth instant the Korean clerks and officials were assigned
certain duties, which they refused to perform. Resignations were sent
in and the Koreans went to their homes, and for several days refused to
attend the offices. A few were arrested by the Japanese.</p>

<p>Nearly all the officials of the Communication Department presented
their resignations a number of times but the resignations were not accepted.</p>

<p>In addition to the previous regulations issued by the Japanese
commander-in-chief, the Foreign Office has been notified of the following:</p>

<p>1. When the Korean government appoints a magistrate the office
of the commander-in-chief must first be notified.</p>

<p>2. Without the consent of the commander-in-chief the magistrate
will not be permitted to go to his post of duty.</p>

<p>3. No mines can be worked or forests be cut down without permission
of the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Complaint is made that coal stored in Pyeng Yang has been secretly
sold without an account being rendered. Request for payment
has been made and a demand to discontinue secret selling.</p>

<p>The magistrate of Chin Chun district reports that more than seventy
members of a so called Righteous Army entered his district from
Chook-san, with their leader Pak Chai-man. They had robbed the people
of rice, money and guns, and departed in the direction of Chung an
district.</p>

<p>Mr. Chung Choo-yeng has been appointed governor of North Kyeng
Sang province.</p>

<p>The Law Department has ordered all judges to post bulletins of the
trials of those sentenced to be hung, so that the public may know the
charges, evidence, and law under which the criminal has been condemned
to death.</p>

<p>The Wonsan Kamni cannot see how ten policemen can satisfactorily
perform the labors it formerly took forty policemen to perform.
He wishes to know why thirty of his policemen have been dismissed,
and he further greatly desires to have their places filled at once.</p>

<p>The Agricultural Department has been requested to grant the use
of the silk worm compound to the Japanese commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>Graduating exercises of the Japanese language school in Chemulpo
were held on the twentieth inst. The Minister, Inspector and other
officers of the Korean Educational Department were in attendance.
The five graduates have been appointed assistant teachers.</p>

<p>The Foreign Office has been notified that the salaries of Japanese
police inspectors in the five wards of Seoul must be paid at once.</p>

<p>On the eighteenth inst. a Japanese notice was posted on the bulletin
boards of the Korean Communication Department that from that
day the Japanese would:</p>

<p>1. Take charge of the Korean ordinary postal service.</p>

<p>2. Take charge of the Korean telegraph and telephone service.</p>

<p>By a special Edict Prince Eui Yang-koon represented His Majesty,
the Emperor of Korea, at the formal ceremony of opening the Seoul-Fusan

Keum Chuk Tai-soo and the attachés received the Pal Kwa and
Tai Keu decorations from His Majesty.</p>

<p>It is proposed to place Korean assistants under the Advisers of the
various Departments in the Korean government, with salaries paid by
the Finance Department.</p>

<p>The director of all the foreign language schools, Mr. Yi Chong-tai,
has communicated with each school to the effect that education is
for the mind, the soul and the body. Of late some students have taken
a dislike to bodily exercise. The teachers are instructed to require
students to take exercise regularly, and all who refuse to obey the order
must be dropped from the rolls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince Yi Chai-wan has asked permission of the Household Department
to erect a paper mill in Yang Kun district, and it has been
granted. When told of this His Majesty ordered the Household Department
to collect the old and useless paper from all the Departments
now and in the future and send it to the paper company without
charge.</p>

<p>On the 13th inst. public exercises of all the primary schools were
held and some suitable rewards were distributed by the Educational
Department to those excelling in their studies.</p>

<p>Trains are running daily over the military road between Seoul and
Pyeng Yang, and the mails are carried regularly. Passenger coaches
are not used, and at present no passenger business is desired; but an
occasional pass is issued so that one may make the journey on an open
flat car, usually loaded with railroad or army equipment. The trip
would doubtless be rather taxing on ladies, and the authorities are at
present chary in granting them permits.</p>

<p>The governor of North Choong Chung asks the Home Department
to see that all magistrates residing in Seoul be sent to the country at
once, because robbers are numerous and the people cannot peacefully
attend to their crops.</p>

<p>The Foreign Department has announced that it will be impossible
to send a special representative to Belgium to the forthcoming congress.</p>

<p>Six inspectors have been appointed by the Law Department.</p>

<p>The Home Department has provided for the stationing of police
as follows: ten each for Mokpo, Sam-wha, Masanpo, Gensan, Sung-chin,
and Yongampo; eight each for Pyeng Yang and Euiju; and four
for Kyeng Heung. The annual expense will be twenty-three thousand
four hundred and eighty-six dollars.</p>

<p>A band of more than thirty robbers have been carrying on their
work by daylight in the Poo Pyung district, and several wealthy Koreans
have fled to Seoul to escape trouble from them.</p>

<p>The Il Chin Hoi have organized a company for the ostensible purpose
of cultivating waste lands, and the Agricultural Department has been
asked to allow it.</p>

have been permitted to go north of Wonsan, by order of the
commanding general.</p>

<p>Five magistrates dismissed for squeezing money from the people
have voluntarily appeared before the Justice Court.</p>

<p>Sixteen thousand one hundred twenty-three dollars ninety cents
and two cash is the amount paid for work on the railroad in Pyeng
San district, Whang Hai province, as reported to the Home Department
by the Finance Department.</p>

<p>Yi To Chai, Minister of the Home Department, sent in his resignation
four different times, and then it was not accepted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Hayashi, Japanese Minister to Korea, has returned to Seoul,
as has also the Japanese Adviser to the Korean Police Department.</p>

<p>Much of the material for the new water works system has arrived,
but government delays have thus far prevented actual work of construction.</p>

<p>The Korean Consul, Mr. Ma Kyeng, has been appointed acting
Minister of the Korean Legation in London.</p>

<p>The Constitutional Society, with Yun Hyo-chung at its head has
received from the Japanese authorities a permit to hold meetings.</p>

<p>The acting Foreign Minister, Yun Chi Ho, has received a request
from the Chinese Minister for the release of a Chinese merchant recently
arrested at Haiju.</p>

<p>A telegram from the Korean Legation in London announces to the
Foreign Department the death of the Acting Minister, Mr. Yi Hon-eung.
A telegram from the Foreign Department to the Legation in
Paris orders the Secretary, Mr. Kim-Myeng-soo, to take charge of
Korea’s diplomatic affairs in London.</p>

<p>Very numerous complaints have reached the Foreign Office on account
of large quantities of nickels having been refused when offered
for exchange. All magistrates in the thirteen provinces had been
warned not to receive nickels not coined by the government; but of
late counterfeit coins have become so numerous that innocent people
suffer greatly and cannot protect themselves. The government out of
pity for the innocent have decided to accept coins whose quality and
form compare favorably with government coins, even though they may
be counterfeit.</p>

<p>No celebration in Korea in modern times has equaled that in Seoul
on the 25th inst. at the formal opening of the Kei-Fu, or Seoul-Fusan
Railway.</p>

<p>Many oxen have been demanded in the north for the purpose of
transporting rice and other commodities to the Japanese army in
Manchuria.</p>

<p>Books are now being printed for the use of those Koreans who
desire to study Japanese without a teacher. Sample volumes have been
presented to His Majesty, the Crown Prince, and others in the Royal
Household.</p>

<p>The Foreign Department has been notified by the Japanese Minister
that according to the announcement of the Japanese Chief of the
Communication Department since he has assumed control of Korean
Communications he will collect all rates from telegraph, telephone and
post offices, and the official salaries will be paid by the Japanese
government.</p>

<p>A contract has been signed with a Japanese fishing company defining
the limits of waters between Japan and Korea where whale fishery
may be carried on in three different districts. The yearly rates have
been increased from four hundred and fifty to nine hundred yen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>From the Korean Legation in Paris a despatch has come stating
that the secretary, Min Sang Hyun, is starting at once for Korea as he
has received notice of the sudden illness of his father. As immediate
departure is necessary there is not time to secure leave of absence. The
government is asked to pay the return expenses.</p>

<p>The magistrate of Hong Wan district has been changed, but as the
former magistrate was entirely satisfactory to the Japanese army
representations have been made that a change is not desirable.</p>

<p>The railway company has been asked to remove posts placed
around the hill near the South Temple.</p>

<p>Agreements with four French engineers have been cancelled and
the Foreign Office has sent to the French Legation eleven thousand
seven hundred and seventy-three yen and thirty cents for salaries,
house rents and traveling expenses.</p>

<p>It is asked that the material which arrives at Fusan to be used in
iron bridges be admitted duty free.</p>

<p>The willow trees in An Pyen district are asked for by the Japanese
authorities for the railway.</p>

<p>Civil service examinations were announced to be held between the
thirteenth and seventeenth of May, to which each Department was
privileged to send not to exceed five men. Vacancies in the office of
clerk in any Department are to be filled in regular order from the ranks
of those passing the examination.</p>

<p>The Home Minister, Mr. Yi To-chai, sent his resignation to His
majesty.</p>

<p>A dealer living in Chongno has secured the monopoly of furnishing
all the Korean national flags throughout the country.</p>

<p>The resignation of Min Yeng Whan, Vice Minister of the Supreme
Court, has been accepted.</p>

<p>The former Chief of Ceremonial Department has been appointed
Vice Minister of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Governors of the various provinces have been asked by the Japanese
commander-in-chief to report the number of horses in each district.</p>

<p>The ex-magistrate of Ko-Wan district, Hamkyeng province, unfolds
a tale to the Home Department of how he was appointed prefect
last September, and proceeded as far as Wonsan on his journey to take
up his work. At Wonsan the commander-in-chief of the Japanese
army detained him. He telegraphed to the Home Department seven
different times but received no reply. Finally the police inspector of
Wonsan took his official seal by force and there was nothing left for him
to do but to return to Seoul which he did four months ago. Now he
has been dismissed, charged with being absent from his post of duty,
and he desires to be relieved of the charge.</p>

<p>Nine Japanese police inspectors and thirteen policemen for the
various districts have arrived in Seoul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>According to the recent military adjustments the monthly expense
for the army is about two hundred and seventy thousand dollars, and
the adviser of the Finance Department is willing to pay but one hundred
and eighty thousand monthly, hence the War Department is short on
salaries.</p>

<p>The home Minister and acting Minister of the Finance Department
presented their resignations but they were not accepted.</p>

<p>On the sixth instant the Japanese representatives appointed to
receive the transfer of the Korean communication Department made a
demand for said transfer on the ground that the government would
appoint special agents to attend to the matter.</p>

<p>His Majesty has issued a proclamation concerning the new laws
which have been promulgated. He calls attention to the fact that
there has been doubt in the minds of magistrates as to whether certain
ancient laws were repealed, and it has therefore been found difficult to
enforce the existing laws. The new laws are made up of the best of
the ancient laws conformed to modern foreign regulations, to be
published throughout the country and observed forever.</p>

<p>The Sunju prefect has been summarily dismissed for squeezing
money from citizens of his district.</p>

<p>The governor of South Pyeng An province reports that the people
are greatly disturbed, and he asks that a good magistrate be sent there
at once.</p>

<p>Cutting of trees on South mountain by the Japanese has been complained
of, and the authorities have been asked to put a stop to it.</p>

<p>The Minister of the Law Department memorialized His Majesty,
stating that law should mean justice and asking permission to appoint
special agents from his department to investigate all the courts of Justice
and Judges and examine the evidence and judgments carefully to see
that no wrong is done. His Majesty acquiesced, and six agents have
been appointed.</p>

<p>The Japanese gendarmes have been asked for permission to form
another political organization by several prominent Koreans.</p>

<p>Human bones are said to have been found scattered along the
road-side near the railway outside of South Gate, probably having been
disinterred when the many graves were removed by railway workmen.
The Home Department has ordered policemen to see that the bones
are properly interred.</p>

<p>The former secretary to the Korean Legation in Russia returned
to Seoul this month.</p>

<p>The Minister of War, Kwan Choong-hyen, has repeatedly sent
in his resignation because of the reduction in the allowance for military
expenditure. He has now been dismissed and Yi Yong Ik, formerly
governor of North Kyeng-san province, has been appointed Minister
of War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The magistrate of Si Heung district complains that the conduct of
Japanese workmen on the railroad is such that the Koreans are all
leaving the district. A reply has been returned that of course such
conduct will cease on completion of the railway.</p>

<p>The kamni of Chemulpo reports the request of the Japanese authorities
for the removal of all the inhabitants from Walmi Island, and
the people are in an uproar.</p>

<p>The chief of Police has proposed to the Home Department to
employ a force of ten men in each ward at ten Yen per month to keep
the streets and gutters free from filth. As there are no funds for the
purpose he proposes to tax each jinrikisha one dollar per month, and
after defraying the expenses of the department he will pay any remaining
money into the Royal Treasury.</p>

<p>In the Chunju district the magistrate has been requested to furnish
one hundred and thirty men daily for work on the Japanese railway
with a daily wage of seventy cents. It is very difficult to take the
men from their fields during the sowing and cultivating season, and if
the fields are neglected the crops will be a failure. The magistrate
asks the government what he shall do.</p>

<p>Special thanks have been sent in an official communication to the
Japanese Minister for exceptional greetings to the Korean Envoy to
Japan, such as providing a Royal ship for his journey and one of the
Royal palaces for his hotel.</p>

<p>The governor of Pusan reports that since the action of the Home
Minister in relation to the police force many police inspectors are
resigning, and he asks that new police regulations be promulgated as
speedily as possible.</p>

<p>A complaint is made to the Foreign Office by the Chinese Minister
that many Koreans are crossing the border into China and causing
disturbances. He asks that this be stopped at once.</p>

<p>The Finance Department has authorized the governor of North
Chulla province to collect taxes by accepting copper cash.</p>

<p>All the governors of the thirteen provinces have been cautioned by
the Finance Department to collect the taxes with great care.</p>

<p>In a cabinet meeting the Ex-minister of communications, Gen.
Min Sang Ho, is said to have created a sensation by declaring the
agreement between the Korean and Japanese governments on postal
matters to be sheer nonsense, and the other Ministers are said to have
remained silent after his denunciation.</p>

<p>By a special Edict the Minister of the Royal Household, Min
Yeng Chul, the General of Royal Officers Yi Koun taik, and the Minister
of the War Department, Yi Yong-ik have been decorated with the
First Degree of Pol Kevai. Yi To-Chai, Minister of the Home Department,
resigned and Yi Chi-yong, Minister of the Law Department,
has been appointed to take his place, and Yi Keun-ho, governor of
Kyeng-kea province has been made Minister of Law.</p>

agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
